- websites by default use the Times New Roman text style

- reminder:
    * General Technique:
        1. Create element with HTML
        2. Style with CSS one-by-one

- paragraphs have default margins

- use html entity checkmarks for symbols

- notes:
    * CSS Specificity: The selector that's more specific has heigher priority
        Meaning → class name selector > element name selector
    * HTML checkmarks:
        1. &#10003; === √ 
        2. &#62; === >
    * css text underline → { text-decoration: underline }
    * HTML elements inside text:
        - <strong></strong> → bold text
        - <u></u> → underlined
        - <span></span> → generic with no styles. We'll style it however we want
