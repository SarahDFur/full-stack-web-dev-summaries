        3 Ways to create variables in JavaScript:
         1. let - can be anything
         2. const - can't be changed after initial assignment - safe
         3. var - like let (original). Has issues

        Tip: ALWAYS use "const" (default). 
             Only if we can't use it ==> "let"

        typeof - will show what is saved inside a variable,
                 not just types like numbers and strings

        <script>
            let variable1 = 3; 
            console.log(variable1);

            let result = variable1 + 2;
            console.log(result);

            let message = 'hello';
            console.log(message); console.log(';');
            
            const variable2 = 3;
            var variable3 = 3;

            console.log(typeof 3);
            console.log(typeof variable1);
