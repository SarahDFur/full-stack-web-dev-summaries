HARD WAY:
- we are not going to set up on local computer
- to set up on local machine -> similar to nmp installations

- react v18 changes!! → see in "index.js"
- if ReactDOM.render() is used → automatically reverts to using React v17

- react interprets plain js objects into html elements → see first challenge in
  "thought-experiment.js"
