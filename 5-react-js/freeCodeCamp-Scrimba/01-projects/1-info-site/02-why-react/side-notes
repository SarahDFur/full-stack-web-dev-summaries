WHY REACT?

- composanle code (like sculpting with legos)
- we can make custom elements

- declarative [opposite of imperative]:
    What should be done?

        "Just tell me what to do, and I'll worry about how I get it done"
        
[- imperative:
    How should it be done?
        "Describe to me every step on how to do something, and I'll do it"]
