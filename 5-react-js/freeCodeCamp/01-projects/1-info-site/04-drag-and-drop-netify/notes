How to deploy projects to web
[This only works with projects using babbel stand-alone]
1. make a Netify account - 
    https://www.netlify.com/?utm_source=scrimba&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=learnreact
2. fill the setup page and click the "Set up and continue" button
3. download the zip file from the scrimba course (for example)
4. go to the Netify Drop site -
    https://app.netlify.com/drop?utm_source=scrimba&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=learnreact
5. drop the entire file
6. you'll get a link to the site
