  PS C:\Users\User\Desktop\full-stack-dev\node-js\free-code-camp\06-npm> npm init
  Debugger attached.
  This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
  It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

  See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
  and exactly what they do.

  Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
  save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

  Press ^C at any time to quit.

    },

  Is this OK? (yes) yes

3: bootstrap - has "jquery" and "popper.js" as well

4: nodemon - makes it easier for developing - no need to write "node" all the time:
  PS C:\Users\User\Desktop\full-stack-dev> npm i nodemon -D 
  Debugger attached.

  added 33 packages, and audited 35 packages in 18s

5: "scripts" in package.json:
  "scripts": { 
    "start": "node app.js"  ==> will run this file when we type "npm start" in the terminal
    "dev": "nodemon app.js" ==> run useing: "npm run dev" (some only work with adding "run")
  }
    - nodemon will spin up all the code we change, so we only need to type out a command
      in the terminal once. The rest of the time (until Ctrl+C), the code will run again.
