- Online Backup:
    * Why? So that if something happens to our computer / code, we have a backup. Similar idea to Google Drive
    * Google Drive let's us do 2 things:
        1. Online backup - by drag-drop folders etc.
        2. Sync Updates by using Google drive on your computer
        3. When something is updated in the drive, it gets updated on the google drive folder on our computer as well.
            * (2-way-sync: 2 & 3)
            * we'll make an online backup and create a 2-way-sync with github
